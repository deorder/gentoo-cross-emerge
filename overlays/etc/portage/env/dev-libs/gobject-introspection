# No bug for this because it requires QEMU. gobject-introspection is a
# giant pain in the ass, as the aging GNOME bug #592311 attests. There
# is even a project dedicated to cross-compiling it and even that
# still requires QEMU. We are not able to make use of that but at
# least the hacks in this file are short.
